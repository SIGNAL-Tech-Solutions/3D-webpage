# SIGNAL
## SIGNAL is a tech device that enables V2X communication for an advanced security on soft mobility.

This repository contains only the files necessary for the AR landing page to function (https://signal-tech-solutions.github.io/3D-webpage/).

This project was developed by Enrico Bettella and Matteo Bevilacqua at the University of Ferrara for our final exam and thesis in the Industrial Product Design course.
The device is currently a proof of concept and therefore it's not real yet.
